player logs in, creates a deck or chooses a deck, we provide a starter deck but the game is about crafting decks and playing with strategy
player then chooses a game 

goal of the game 
    destroy the other team's base (add outposts later), and kill all characters 
    if you kill the base the users go rogue and become difficult to kill 
    if you kill the players then you attack the base, but the base can still create new characters. 
    the idea is to take both out at the same time by using strategy and deception. 

1v1 

each player starts wtih a base and a character
